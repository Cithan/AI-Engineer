The Importance and Benefits of Dashboards\n","\n","Dashboards in WanDB provide a centralized, visual representation of your machine learning model's performance. It allows for real-time tracking of multiple aspects of a run, such as loss, accuracy, and other custom metrics.\n","\n","The benefits of using dashboards include:\n","\n","1. **Collaboration**: Dashboards allow team members to share their results and insights, fostering a collaborative environment.\n","\n","2. **Visualization**: They provide clear visualizations of complex data, which can reveal patterns and insights that might be hard to understand in raw, numeric format.\n","\n","3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Dashboards are updated in real-time, enabling you to immediately identify and rectify any issues during the training process.\n","\n","## B. Your Dashboard\n","\n","When we create a project, WanDB will automatically create a dashboard for it, you can find it using the left navigation bar icon called Workspace.\n","\n","You can view it here: [WanDB Dashboard](https://wandb.ai/ricky-kurniawan/cifar10-classification/workspace?workspace=user-ricky-kurniawan)\n","\n","Here's a screenshot:\n","\n","<img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/rg-ai-bootcamp/mlops/wandb-project.png width=\"800\" height=\"400\">\n","\n","\n","### Runs\n","\n","The area between the navigation bar on the left and the Sections on the right is called Runs. This area shows all the completed working run on the model.\n","\n","<img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/rg-ai-bootcamp/mlops/wandb-runs.png width=\"200\" height=\"400\">\n","\n","### Sections\n","\n","The dashboard is divided into sections. In the screenshot we can see 3 sections:\n","1. Charts - Display charts related to the model.\n","2. System - Display charts related to the hardware used to run the model.\n","3. Hidden Panel - A special section to hide the charts that you find important but don't want to clutter the other sections.\n","\n","If we want to add a new section, we can click on the `Add Section` button at the bottom.\n","\n","<img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/rg-ai-bootcamp/mlops/wandb-section.png width=\"800\" height=\"400\">\n","\n","### Panels\n","\n","Inside each sections we have panels. If we look at the Charts section, there are 3 panels or charts inside. Each panel can be customized and edited. If we want to add a new panel, there is an `Add Panel` button at the top right of the section.\n","\n","<img src=https://storage.googleapis.com/rg-ai-bootcamp/mlops/wandb-panel.png width=\"400\" height=\"200\">\n","\n","## C. Customizing Your Dashboard\n","\n","You can customize your dashboard to showcase the data that are most relevant to you:\n","\n","1. **Adding Visualizations**: Click on the `Add Panel` icon in a section to add a visualization. You can choose from a variety of chart types, such as line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and more.\n","\n","2. **Rearranging Sections**: To rearrange sections in your dashboard, simply drag and drop them into the desired order.\n","\n","3. **Editing Section Titles**: Click on the section title to edit it.\n","\n","## D. Tracking Important Project Information\n","\n","Tracking important project information on your dashboard is crucial for evaluation and decision-making:\n","\n","- **Model Performance Metrics**: Track key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC, among others, depending on your specific use case.\n","\n","- **System Metrics**: You can also track system metrics like GPU usage, CPU usage, memory usage, and more to understand the computational efficiency of your model.\n","\n","- **Hyperparameters**: Track the hyperparameters used in each run to understand their impact on the model's performance.\n","\n","- **Loss Graphs**: Visualize how your model's loss changes over time to identify if and when your model is converging.\n","\n","Remember, what you track will depend on your project's specific goals and requirements."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"086f49d6-7a40-4cfe-b36e-a5b031291ca1","metadata":{"id":"086f49d6-7a40-4cfe-b36e-a5b031291ca1"},"source":["# Monitoring Models with WanDB\n","\n","## A. Uploading a Model for Monitoring\n","\n","Once you've trained your model, you can upload it to WanDB for monitoring:\n","\n","1. Save your model in a format that is convenient for you (e.g., .h5 for Keras models, .pt for PyTorch models).\n","2. Use the `wandb.save` function to save your model:\n","\n","```python\n","wandb.save(\"path_to_your_model\")\n","```\n","\n","This creates a new artifact with the contents of your file and links it to your run.\n","\n","If you run your model inside a Jupyter notebook and did not use wandb.save then WanDB will create an artifact pointing to your Jupyter notebook.\n","\n","## B. Understanding the Metrics and Logs\n","\n","WanDB allows you to log various types of metrics:\n","\n","- **System Metrics**: These metrics include CPU usage, memory usage, GPU temperature, etc. They can be helpful to monitor the computational efficiency of your model.\n","\n","- **Model Metrics**: These are metrics that indicate the performance of your model, such as loss, accuracy, precision, recall, etc.\n","\n","- **Custom Metrics**: You can also create and log custom metrics based on your specific needs.\n","\n","To log a metric, use the `wandb.log` function:\n","\n","```python\n","wandb.log({\"metric_name\": metric_value})\n","```\n","\n","## C. Interpreting Graphs and Charts\n","\n","WanDB provides a variety of graphs and charts to visualize your logged data:\n","\n","- **Line Plots**: These are used primarily to track changes in metrics over time, like loss or accuracy during the training process.\n","\n","- **Histograms**: These can be used to visualize the distribution of a metric or parameter.\n","\n","- **Scatter Plots**: These can be used to explore the relationship between two variables.\n","\n","- **Bar Charts**: These can be useful to compare the performance of different models or runs.\n","\n","You can mouse over any point on a graph or chart to see the exact values, and you can click on any point to go to the corresponding step in the run.\n","\n","## D. Comparing Different Models\n","\n","WanDB makes it easy to compare different models or runs:\n","\n","1. Go to the project page on the Wandb web application.\n","2. Use the checkboxes next to each run to select the runs you want to compare.\n","3. Click on the 'Compare' button to see a side-by-side comparison of the selected runs.\n","\n","In the comparison view, you can see a variety of information, including the values of different metrics, the system and model parameters, and more. This feature makes it easy to identify the best-performing model and understand why it performs well."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b3b96997-6aea-4c97-a6ac-84a813399502","metadata":{"id":"b3b96997-6aea-4c97-a6ac-84a813399502"},"source":["Let's view a few examples of WanDB usage:\n","\n","- CIFAR10 Model: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lmTWG1xaQLhIQLDcu_LS6PYVAo_dBK3H?usp=sharing\n","- CIFAR10 WanDB: https://wandb.ai/ayamerushia/cifar10-cnn-wandb/overview\n","\n","- Text Classification on Huggingface Model : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RzLVrmtmdQL9Szo6IT7jX8xkmYXi_Jcr?usp=sharing\n","- Text Classification on Huggingface WanDB: https://wandb.ai/ayamerushia/indo-roberta-small-finetune-sentiment-analysis/overview?workspace=user-ayamerushia\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.3"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1_NS--gSZb_DbH1qLGkA9liufF5BeZq3T","timestamp":1710915829651}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
