You are required to **submit the Accuracy Score and F1 score** in the Submission section below.\n","\n","In the code block below, you can use the comments to guide you on what to do.\n","\n","We have also provided 3 variables that you must use in your code, `ml_features`, `ml_accuracy` and `ml_f1_score`. You can move the variables around your code, assign values to them, but you cannot delete them."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"id":"1aa3c3f7-c6c5-4419-9b25-e8d7a8ec345a","metadata":{"id":"1aa3c3f7-c6c5-4419-9b25-e8d7a8ec345a","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1705988333599,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":4095,"user":{"displayName":"Citra Handan","userId":"02659360695432655610"}},"outputId":"3d389333-3db3-44c1-a368-066365d4b957"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["clasification report\n","              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n","\n","           0       0.68      0.46      0.55        28\n","           1       1.00      1.00      1.00      5105\n","\n","    accuracy                           1.00      5133\n","   macro avg       0.84      0.73      0.78      5133\n","weighted avg       1.00      1.00      1.00      5133\n","\n","confusion matrix\n","[[  13   15]\n"," [   6 5099]]\n","f1_score\n","0.997945004403562\n","accuracy score\n","0.9959088252483927\n"]}],"source":["# Write your code here\n","\n","# Define the target output (Good >= 75)\n","y = df_FIFA21['Overall'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x >= 50 else 0)\n","\n","X = df_FIFA21.loc[:,[\"Age\",\"Value\",\"Wage\",\"Potential\",\"Special\",\"ShortPassing\",\n","                     \"Reactions\",\"ShotPower\",\"Composure\",\"Release Clause\"]]\n","# Identify the features you will use in your model\n","ml_features = [\"Age\",\"Value\",\"Wage\",\"Potential\",\"Special\",\"ShortPassing\",\n","                     \"Reactions\",\"ShotPower\",\"Composure\",\"Release Clause\"]\n","\n","# Split data into training set and test set\n","X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=.3, random_state=42, stratify=y)\n","\n","# Scale the features (if needed, optional)\n","\n","\n","# Train the model\n","xgb_clf = xgb.XGBClassifier(max_depth=5, n_estimators=1000, learning_rate=0.3,\n","                            n_jobs=-1)\n","xgb_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","# Make predictions using the test set\n","print('clasification report')\n","print(classification_report(y_test, xgb_clf.predict(X_test)))\n","print('confusion matrix')\n","print(confusion_matrix(y_test, xgb_clf.predict(X_test)))\n","print('f1_score')\n","print(f1_score(y_test, xgb_clf.predict(X_test)))\n","print('accuracy score')\n","print(accuracy_score(y_test, xgb_clf.predict(X_test)))\n","\n","# Evaluate the model\n","ml_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, xgb_clf.predict(X_test))\n","ml_f1_score = f1_score(y_test, xgb_clf.predict(X_test))\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5d59af48-18c0-4e40-80ff-33a85030b205","metadata":{"id":"5d59af48-18c0-4e40-80ff-33a85030b205"},"source":["## Submission\n","\n","Once you are satisfied with the performance of your model, then you run the code block below to submit your project.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"id":"010d7f7f-711d-4f41-82a3-3c2562e59709","metadata":{"id":"010d7f7f-711d-4f41-82a3-3c2562e59709","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1705988343598,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":4227,"user":{"displayName":"Citra Handan","userId":"02659360695432655610"}},"outputId":"f25fb18a-a8bf-4876-c680-54969ddd55c9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'Assignment successfully submitted'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":14}],"source":["# Submit Method\n","\n","# Do not change the code below\n","question_id = \"01_ml_project_features\"\n","submit(student_id, name, assignment_id, str(ml_features), question_id, drive_link)\n","question_id = \"02_ml_project_accuracy\"\n","submit(student_id, name, assignment_id, str(ml_accuracy), question_id, drive_link)\n","question_id = \"03_ml_project_f1score\"\n","submit(student_id, name, assignment_id, str(ml_f1_score), question_id, drive_link)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"aa89b9ff-0d31-416a-b3c4-851c725fadf7","metadata":{"id":"aa89b9ff-0d31-416a-b3c4-851c725fadf7"},"source":["## FIN"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.3"},"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1945W5_yZyN2SUkVrNmY2-M-qWeBsG6Wq","timestamp":1705892274979}]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
