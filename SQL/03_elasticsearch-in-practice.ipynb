But how do we use Elasticsearch for more than one application? A common practice is to prefix the index name with the application's name, for example: applicationname_indexname. This way, index names do not conflict between applications.\n","\n","### Creating an Index\n","\n","To create an Index, we can make an HTTP call like so:\n","  \n","```bash\n","PUT /{index_name}\n","```\n","\n","The rules for index names are as follows:\n","\n","- They must be lowercase.\n","- No special characters are allowed, except for -, +, and _, but these cannot be at the start.\n","- They cannot be longer than 255 bytes.\n","\n","By creating unique index names, you ensure that data from different applications is stored separately and can be queried independently."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3zG75nnrmI0a"},"source":["Before we start practicing, install the elasticsearch
