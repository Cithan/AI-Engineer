Follow the website's instructions to download.\n","\n","### Elasticsearch Configuration\n","\n","Upon setup, adjust some configurations:\n","\n","1. **X-Pack:** Disable X-Pack, a paid feature developed by Elastic.\n","2. **Configuration File:** All configurations are in the `config/elasticsearch.yml` file.\n","3. **Configuration Format:** Elasticsearch uses the YAML format for its configuration.

This is usually done by accessing the root path, or home page, of your Elasticsearch instance. If your Elasticsearch server is running locally, the URL will typically be `http://localhost:9200`.\n","\n","When you navigate to this URL, you should see a JSON response with information about your Elasticsearch instance.
