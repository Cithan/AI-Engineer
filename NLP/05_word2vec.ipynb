Our input will start as a one-hot encoded vector. We've learned it before: A vector which only has one element as 1 and the rest are 0s. This vector will represent our input word.\n","\n","2. This one-hot encoded vector is fully connected to a hidden layer where every individual neuron represents different focused contexts gathered from training. One neuron might be focused on the tense of verbs, while another might focus on gender differences in pronouns, and so on.\n","\n","3. The hidden layer is then fully connected to an output layer which uses softmax to produce probabilities for every word in the vocab.\n","\n","This last step is crucial to understand how Word2Vec understand relations between words\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"0DAl-SjXp_Z8"},"source":["## The Intuition\n","\n","If we read a lot of sentences like:\n","\n","- \"the king ordered the citizens to leave the city\"\n","- \"the ruler ordered the citizens to leave the city\"\n","- \"the king commanded the citizens to evacuate the city\"\n","- \"the ruler commanded the citizens to evacuate the city\"\n","\n","We shall see that the words \"king\" and \"ruler\" are used in similar contexts, i.e. \"king\" should be close to \"ruler\" in the vector space.\n","\n","\"commanded\" and \"ordered\" are also used in similar contexts, so they should be close to each other as well.\n","\n","Let's try other examples:\n","\n","- \"fish swims in the water\"\n","- \"the water is home to many fish\"\n","- \"the fish is dead because of the polluted water\"\n","- \"water is essential for fish to live\"\n","\n","We see that \"fish\" and \"water\" often appear together.
